## 1. Python Introduction

This chapter introduces you to Python, covering its history, features, and why it's a popular programming language for beginners and professionals alike.

---

## 2. Python Basics

In this section, you will learn the fundamental concepts of Python programming, including basic syntax, variables, data types, and how to write your first Python program.

---

## 3. Operators in Python

Python provides various types of operators, such as arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, <, >), logical operators (and, or, not), and more. This section explains these operators and their usage in Python.

---

## 4. Strings in Python

Strings are a fundamental data type in Python. Here, you'll learn how to manipulate strings, including methods for converting case, replacing text, and slicing strings.

---

## 5. Lists in Python

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. This section covers list creation, accessing elements, adding or removing elements, and common list operations.

---

## 6. Tuples in Python

Similar to lists, tuples are another way to store multiple items in Python. However, tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. This section explains tuple creation, accessing elements, and tuple operations.

---

## 7. Sets in Python

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. In this part, you'll learn about set creation, adding or removing elements, set operations like union, intersection, and difference, and how sets can be used in Python.

---

## 8. Dictionaries in Python

Dictionaries are used to store key-value pairs. This section covers dictionary creation, accessing values by keys, adding or removing key-value pairs, and common dictionary operations.

---

## 9. Python Conditional Statements

Conditional statements (if, elif, else) allow you to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. This chapter explains how to use conditional statements effectively in Python.

---

## 10. Loops in Python

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python supports for loops and while loops. Here, you'll learn how to use loops for iteration and looping through data structures.

---

## 11. Functions in Python

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. This section covers function definition, parameters, return values, and how to call functions in Python.

---

## 12. Modules in Python

Modules are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other Python programs. This chapter explains module creation, importing modules, and using module functions or variables.

---

## 13. Exceptions and File Handling

Python provides built-in mechanisms for handling errors (exceptions) and working with files. This section covers exception handling using try-except blocks and file handling operations like opening, reading, writing, and closing files.

---

## 14. Classes in Python

Classes and objects are key concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). This part introduces you to classes, constructors, methods, inheritance, and how to create and use objects in Python.

---

## 15. Basic Python-Based Project

In this final chapter, you'll apply the concepts learned throughout the tutorial to create a basic Python-based project. This project will demonstrate your understanding of Python programming and how to structure a simple project.
